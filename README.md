# Code to implement the method from the paper entitled "Estimating longitudinal causal effects with participant noncompliance and confounders with unknown densities".

## Requires the R programming language.

## There are three files:
### 1) true_causal_mean.Rmd, an RMD file that calculates the true causal mean by Monte Carlo integration.
### 2) G_comp.Rmd, an RMD file that gives an example of how to implement each of the G-computation algorithm estimators.
### 3) em_reg.Rmd, an RMD file that gives an example of how to implement the EM-REG estimator from Boatman et al. (2018).
